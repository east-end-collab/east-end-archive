### [East End Cemetery Map](https://dsl.richmond.edu/eastend/#loc=18/37.53651812109586/-77.387872338295)

Years in the making, this map pinpoints the locations of grave markers at East End using GIS technology and drone imagery. As of May 2020, GPS coordinates have been collected for upwards of 3,200 markers. We are working to refine the accuracy of the map, and points will be added as new markers are found. The map was created and is maintained through a partnership with the Digital Scholarship Lab (DSL) and the Spatial Analysis Lab (SAL) at the Univeristy of Richmond.

The [Digital Scholarship Lab](https://dsl.richmond.edu/) develops innovative digital humanities projects that contribute to research and teaching at and beyond the University of Richmond.\

The [Spatial Analysis Laboratory](https://geography.richmond.edu/spatial-analysis-lab/) (SAL) is the Department of Geography and the Environment’s lab for GIS, spatial analysis, and remote sensing courses, where students learn the underlying principles of spatial analysis and technology.

### [East End Cemetery RVA](https://eastendcemeteryrva.com/)

Brian Palmer and Erin Hollaway Palmer, journalists as well as founding members of the [Friends of East End Cemetery](https://friendsofeastend.com/), conceived of this website and worked with [Jolene Smith ](https://jolenesmith.net/post/eecwp/)to create it. The ever-expanding site is a vital part of the effort to restore East End Cemetery.

The [physical cleanup project ](https://eastendcemetery.wordpress.com/)reclaims this once manicured memorial park from nature and neglect. This website seeks to reclaim the history of the cemetery and the community it served from obscurity.

We designed [eastendcemeteryrva.com ](http://eastendcemeteryrva.com/)as a visually dynamic, interactive resource that features photographs made at East End as well as archival images from public-domain sources and from relatives of the deceased; primary documents about the cemetery and the people buried there; and narratives that we create from these materials. The site is also designed to accept content from users—photos, documents, stories.
