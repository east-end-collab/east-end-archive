**[East End Cemetery Map](https://dsl.richmond.edu/eastend/#loc=18/37.53651812109586/-77.387872338295)**

Years in the making, this map pinpoints the locations of grave markers at East End using GIS technology and drone imagery. As of September 2020, nearly 3,250 markers have been mapped, with points indicating their precise positions in the cemetery. Points will continue to be added as markers are found. The map was created and is maintained through a partnership with the [Digital Scholarship Lab](http://dsl.richmond.edu/) and the [Spatial Analysis Lab](https://sal-urichmond.hub.arcgis.com/) at the University of Richmond.

A visually dynamic resource, this website situates the cemetery and the people buried there in their historical context and features photographs made through the years at East End, as well as archival images from public-domain sources and from relatives of the deceased. Like the archive, the site is designed to accept content from users—photos, documents, stories—and contains a growing number of short biographies written by family members and other researchers.\*\*

[For the Forgotten African American Dead:](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/07/opinion/sunday/for-the-forgotten-african-american-dead.html) Richmond, Va. — To get to East End Cemetery in Henrico County, Va., an abandoned African-American graveyard, my wife, Erin, and I drive through a predominantly black Richmond neighborhood — our neighborhood. Decades of neglect have turned this once beautiful burial ground into woodland. We’re part of a volunteer effort that has reclaimed about two and a half of East End’s 16 acres since it began in 2013.
