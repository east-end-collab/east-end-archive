East End Cemetery (est. 1897) is a historic African American burial ground in Henrico County and the city of Richmond, Virginia. Since 2013, volunteers led by the Friends of East End have been working to reclaim the cemetery from nature and neglect, uncovering thousands of long-obscured grave markers.
