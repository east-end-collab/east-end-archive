Tancil, one of the best known physicians and public spirited citizens in this State, took place from the Mt. Olivet Baptist Church, Rev. J. Andrew Bowler, the pastor officiating. The services were inspiring and sympathetic and a large crowd thronged the church edifice and packed the streets surrounding the place of the impressive ceremonies. Funeral Director Robert C. Scott, the well-known transporter of the dead, had charge of the remains.  Rev. Bowler was at his best and coupled with the solemn anthems of the choir and other selected singers, the exercises will long be remembered on Church Hill. It would fill a book to give a detailed account of Dr. Tancil’s work among these people, where he had chosen to reside. He left a daughter, Mrs. Pearl Tancil Langston, who is now a resident of Philadelphia; a son, Richard F. Tancil, Jr. Mrs. Tancil had preceded her husband to the grave. The services took place at twelve o’clock last Sundoy.

I think this is the same Ann J Williams because the witness on the certificate is daughter Mary, and the deceased was widowed at the time of death. Ann J and Thomas F Williams are listed in the 1900 census as having a daughter named Mary, and Thomas died in 1911. Also the estimated date of birth on the death certificate (1854) is close to that given on the 1900 and 1910 censuses (1860)",,,,,yes,,,,,,Not Available,,https://forum.jstor.org/assets/27475374/representation-view
