Co.,10/4/1930,1,"Capital City Lodge of Elks Enters New Second St. Home.  Formally Dedicated Sunday September 28, 1930.  The Capital City Lodge Elks, received congratulations from various clubs and fraternal organizations here during the open-celebration of their home at 526 N. Second street. The home is situated in the heart of the Negro business section of Richmond, being situated between Clay and Leigh streets, across the street from the Commercial Bank and Trust Co., between the Hippodrome and Globe theatre's. A brief description of the home is as follows: On entering the front door, not he left is a ladies rest room and parlor, which is fitted out with modern comfortable chairs, lounge, library table and piano.  The chairs and lounge being upholstered in tapestry and Jacquard velour, on the right is the gents maker and Billiard room equipped with Cigar stand, three cushion billiard tables and all the accoutrements that go in to make a modern and up to date billiard room.  To the rear of the billiard room is found the well stocked Cafeteria and Grill, uncharge of the efficient Steward, Mr. Junius Jones: to the left of the Grill across the hall is the Card room, where members may indulge in social games for their amusement.  Close inspection of this room convinced the writer that most Capital City members are very fond of Dominoes.  On the second floor to our left at the landing we find Mr. Frye's Barber-shop, next to which is found the Secretary's Office, where Mr. Green seems to be the dominant figure; going to the front we find a porch which gives a most magnificent view of the Negro business section of Richmond, the Auditorium and Dance hall occupied the entire right side of the second floor, with a raised dais in the extreme front end for the accommodation of the orchestra, the check-room being in the extreme rear. Benjamin Temple ladies occupy the front portion across the hall from the auditorium.  No use describing this part of the building as you all know how the ladies fix up their rooms.  On the third floor is found the Band room, two committee rooms, the Library and the Directors room.  The furniture and fixtures in the directors room ""just wont dont,"" across the hall from the directors room is found the Library where we get another grand view of Richmond's Negro Broadway, and where we are afraid many of the members who have left their best days behind them will develop ""cricks in the neck"" from ""looking em over.""  There is to be found, unusual conveniences for women and men alike on each floor of the building.  On the whole the Elks of Capital City lodge deserve the credit and commendation which has so lavishly been bestowed on them by the populace, for the home is a finely appointed and as elaborately furnished, as any that we have seen in these parts.  More power to the Capital City lodge Elks in general and to ""Tom Ellis,"" and his Board of Directors in particular.    ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://forum.jstor.org/assets/28528109/representation-view

Albert Clay, Colored, Dies From Knife Thrust at Hands of Another Negro.
Albert Clay, colored, was so seriously stabbed by Magnus Jenkins, another negro, at 2100 North Twenty-first Street last night that he died an hour later at Virginia Hospital. The scene of the stabbing was just outside the city limits. 
Clay was stabbed in the left arm, an artery being severed. Ambulance Surgeon Anderson gave first aid at the scene and took the injured man to the hospital. He had lost so much blood that he died ten minutes after being placed on the operating table. The stabbing occurred about 7 o'clock.
Chief of Police Seay, of Henrico County, with Policemen Jones and Hanky, of the local force, succeeded in locating Jenkins early this morning in a house on Thirty-first Street, between P and Q Streets. They arrested Jenkins there and later locked him in the County Jail, where he is being held pending arraignment before a magistrate to-day. Jenkins refused last night to discuss the cutting.

CALLOWAY Dr. Samuel Dismond Calloway, one of the energetic and successful young dentists of Richmond, has firmly established himself in a good practice and enters heartily into the professional, business and social life of the city. Not a few young men think it necessary, after going through college, to go away from home in order to succeed. a few, however, take up the work of life and succeed in their native towns, among those who know their characters and understand their abilities best. Dr. Calloway is among this number. He was born at Richmond, Nov. 10, 1885. His parents were John and Ella (Tinsley) Calloway. John Calloway was a son of Mary Calloway, while Ella Tinsley was a daughter of Carolina Tinsley. As a boy, young Calloway attended the local public schools, from which he passed to Virginia Union University, where he took the preparatory course. Thus equipped, he matriculated at Howard University, Washington, D. C., for his dental course, and won his D. D. S. degree in 1912. By hard work and close economy, he was able to maintain himself in school and complete his course without a break.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://forum.jstor.org/assets/28821883/representation-view

Description of photograph from Ohio Memory website (https://ohiopix.org/record-display/p267401coll32/15217): Description: This photograph from the Ohio Penitentiary in Columbus is of 24-year-old hospital employee Theodore ""Ted"" McClure. His formal attire suggests that the photograph was taken during his trial or sentencing. McClure was the 278th individual to be executed via the electric chair in Ohio. The caption at the bottom reads: “No. 278 Theodore Roosevelt McClure of Cuyahoga County, Legally Electrocuted May 10, 1950, for the Murder of Nicola Salnpo.” The victim's name is spelled Nicholas Salupo in period newspaper articles. In 1885 the Ohio Penitentiary in Columbus, Ohio, became the location for all executions, which previously took place in the various county seats. In 1896 the Ohio General Assembly mandated that electrocution replace hanging as the form of capital punishment. The Ohio Penitentiary regularly offered tours as well as souvenir photographs and postcards of the building and prisoners on death row. A total of 315 prisoners, both men and women, were executed in the electric chair known as “Old Sparky” between 1897 and 1963. View on Ohio Memory.

F. Tancil Gone,Richmond Planet,45,19,"Richmond, Virginia",Planet Pub. Co.,3/17/1928,1,"DR. R. F. TANCIL GONE  The funeral services of Dr. R. F. Tancil, one of the best known physicians and public spirited citizens in this State, took place from the Mt. Olivet Baptist Church, Rev. J. Andrew Bowler, the pastor officiating. The services were inspiring and sympathetic and a large crowd thronged the church edifice and packed the streets surrounding the place of the impressive ceremonies. Funeral Director Robert C. Scott, the well-known transporter of the dead, had charge of the remains.  Rev. Bowler was at his best and coupled with the solemn anthems of the choir and other selected singers, the exercises will long be remembered on Church Hill. It would fill a book to give a detailed account of Dr. Tancil’s work among these people, where he had chosen to reside. He left a daughter, Mrs. Pearl Tancil Langston, who is now a resident of Philadelphia; a son, Richard F. Tancil, Jr. Mrs. Tancil had preceded her husband to the grave. The services took place at twelve o’clock last Sundoy.

(Second note) Dr. Walter Brown, 901 North 27th Street, Richmond, Virginia. Dear Sir: Our certificate #26509 is for the death of Silas Thompson, a colored man, aged 44 years, who died December 31, 1932. You give as the cause, ""Nephritis,"" with the date of onset as November 15th, with ""Bronchitis,"" date of onset October 15th, as contributory. Were you able to determine the cause of the acute nephritis? We do not ordinarily expect it to proceed from bronchitis. I would desire further to know whether you excluded tuberculosis of the lungs by State or city laboratory test, and if so, how many tests were made. Bronchitis is not a frequent cause of death for one as young as he. Reply on this letter in the enclosed penalty envelope which requires no postage. Very truly yours, W.A. Plecker, M.D. State Registrar Special Agent (Third note handwritten) Silas Thompson drank a great deal of bootleg whiskey prior to his illness which I think was cause of his nephritis. He did not have Tuberculosis. B.",Correspondence between Doctor and State Registrar on the cause of death for Silas Thompson.,,,"Letter asks the writer of the certificate if they excluded tuberculosis of the lungs on the grounds that Bronchitis does not generally lead to death in a man that young, and is not usually lead to nephritis. 

The response at the bottom is that: 
1. Decedent drank a lot of bootleg whiskey which lead to nephritis 
2. Decedent did not have Tuberculosis",,,,,,,,,,,,,https://forum.jstor.org/assets/28269894/representation-view
